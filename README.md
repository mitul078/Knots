# Knots

Knots is a modern **social media web application** inspired by platforms like Threads and Twitter, but with a broader vision of **fostering fast connections, collaborations, and friendships**.

This project is currently under active development and was built as part of my full-stack learning journey. Within the first month, I implemented several **core social networking features**, while designing the architecture to scale into a fully-fledged collaborative platform in the future.
